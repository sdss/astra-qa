# Summary

::: {.callout-warning}
## No description set

A summary description is needed for this pipeline.
:::


The pipeline summary files include;

```{python}
qa.render_links_to_summary_files(MODEL)
```

Pipelines are usually executed on coadded spectra and on visit (epoch) spectra. 
Even if a pipeline only runs on spectra from one instrument (e.g., APOGEE), there are still many derivative products of those spectra, and different ways they can be stored.

For example, a pipeline might require the input spectra to be at the rest frame and resampled onto a common wavelength grid, so it is not expected to report results from spectra that are stored in the observed frame.
Or there might be multiple variants of rest-frame spectra of the same observation, which vary in how they were resampled or combined. 

The table below lists all spectrum models in `astra`, and the number of pipeline results for that spectrum model.

```{python}
qa.render_row_counts_by_spectrum_model(MODEL)
```

The following figure shows the number of visit spectra and the number of pipeline results as a function of time, which can be useful for identifying any chronological chunks of missing or problematic data.
Here we are showing visit spectra from the spectrum model that is most frequently analysed by this pipeline.

```{python}
#| out-width: 100%
#| fig-format: png
fig = qa.plot_visits_by_mjd(VISIT_SPECTRUM_MODEL, MODEL)
```

## Kiel diagrams

```{python}
#| label: fig-hrd
#| fig-cap: "Kiel diagram of all unflagged results reported by this pipeline (on coadds and visits)."

data = np.atleast_2d(
    list(
        MODEL
        .select(
            MODEL.teff,
            MODEL.logg,
            MODEL.fe_h,
        )
        .where(MODEL.teff.is_null(False))
        .tuples()
    )
)

fig = qa.plot_kiel_two_panel(*data.T, x_lims=(3000, 30000), y_lims=(0, 5))

# Calibrations

## Error model

### Formal (raw) error

These plots show the log density of raw formal error reported by the pipeline as a function of spectrum S/N ratio.

```{python}
fig = qa.plot_formal_error_wrt_snr(MODEL, (VISIT_SPECTRUM_MODEL, ))
```

### Calibrated error

```{python}
fig = qa.plot_z_scores("HotPayne")
```
